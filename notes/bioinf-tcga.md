## Basic knowledge

***malignancy*** [məˈlɪɡnənsi]: https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045771&version=Patient&language=English.
A term for diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control and can invade nearby tissues. 
Malignant cells can also spread to other parts of the body through the blood and lymph systems.
There are several main types of malignancy. Also called cancer.

- *Carcinoma* [ˌkɑːsɪˈnəʊmə] is a malignancy that begins in the skin or in tissues that line or cover internal organs. 
- *Sarcoma* [sɑːˈkəʊmə] is a malignancy that begins in bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, blood vessels, or other connective or supportive tissue.
- *Leukemia* [lu:'ki:mɪə] is a malignancy that starts in blood-forming tissue, such as the bone marrow, and causes large numbers of abnormal blood cells to be produced and enter the blood. 
- *Lymphoma* [lɪmˈfəʊmə] and *multiple myeloma* [ˌmaɪəˈləʊmə] are malignancies that begin in the cells of the immune system.
- *Central nervous system cancers* are malignancies that begin in the tissues of the brain and spinal cord.
